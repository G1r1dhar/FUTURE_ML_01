# Sales Forecasting for Retail Business

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a time series forecasting model to predict future sales trends for a retail business. The objective is to analyze historical sales data, identify key patterns, trends, and seasonality, and build a predictive model to assist in future sales planning and decision-making.

## Skills Gained
- Time Series Forecasting
- Regression Analysis
- Trend Analysis

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python Programming Language
- Facebook Prophet (Forecasting Library)
